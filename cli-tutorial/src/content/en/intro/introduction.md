# Pantheon-CLI Introduction

Welcome to the Pantheon-CLI tutorial!

## What is Pantheon-CLI?

**We're not just building another CLI tool—we're defining how scientists interact with data in the AI era.**

Pantheon-CLI is the first fully open-source, infinitely extensible scientific "vibe analysis" framework, built entirely on Python. It's designed for complex single-cell and spatial genomics analysis while transcending the capability boundaries of all existing tools.

## Core Features

### **PhD-Level Scientific Assistant**
Pantheon-CLI is the first command-line intelligent agent assistant for complex real-world scientific analysis, capable of handling PhD-level single-cell and spatial genomics tasks, along with many other cutting-edge scientific challenges. This is not just a tool—it's an AI scientist on your research team.

### **Hybrid Programming Magic** 
With Pantheon-CLI, you can work within the same environment to:
- Write Python code on the first line
- Use natural language descriptions on the next line
- Even mix in R/Julia languages

All scientists need only focus on the analysis itself, without switching between different tools and environments. This hybrid programming paradigm makes data science more fluid than ever before.

### **Open Source, Powerful, Python-First**
- **Fully Open Source** - The first completely open-source scientific AI analysis framework with transparent, auditable source code
- **Infinitely Extensible** - Based on the Python ecosystem, supporting unlimited customization and extension
- **Python-First** - Fully leveraging Python's powerful ecosystem in scientific computing

### **Data Privacy First**
- **Your data belongs to you** - Full support for local large language model execution
- **Zero upload requirements** - All analysis is performed on your local computer
- **Completely offline operation** - Protects your sensitive research data and meets data compliance requirements

## Installation

Pantheon-CLI supports simple installation via pip, but requires API key support to use large language model functionality.

```bash
pip install pantheon-cli
```

**Let's redefine data analysis together and drive scientific research forward in the AI era!**
