# Dialog Commands

Pantheon-CLI's core advantage lies in its natural language dialog capabilities, allowing scientists to describe analysis needs in human language while the system automatically generates and executes corresponding code.

## 1. Basic Dialog Mode

### 1.1 Natural Language Description
Directly describe the analysis you want to perform in English or Chinese, and Pantheon-CLI will intelligently understand and execute.

### 1.2 Hybrid Programming Mode
Freely switch between natural language, Python, R, Julia, and other programming languages within the same session.

### 1.3 Intelligent Context Understanding
The system remembers previous analysis steps and data states, providing a coherent analysis experience.

## Best Practices

### Universal Disciplinary Principles
1. **Clear description**: Accurately describe analysis goals and expected results
2. **Step-by-step approach**: Break complex analysis into manageable steps
3. **Validate results**: Check the reasonableness of results after each step
4. **Save checkpoints**: Use `/save` to save key analysis nodes

### Interdisciplinary Application Strategies
1. **Clarify disciplinary background**: Specify your research field and data type
2. **Learn from other fields**: Actively inquire about relevant methods from other disciplines
3. **Methodological integration**: Combine analytical frameworks from different fields
4. **Multi-perspective result interpretation**: Understand analysis results from multiple disciplinary angles

### Efficient Dialog Techniques
1. **Use professional terminology**: Appropriately use domain-specific vocabulary for precision
2. **Provide context**: Explain data sources, research purposes, and expected applications
3. **Flexible adjustment**: Adjust analysis strategies based on preliminary results
4. **Active exploration**: Inquire about relevant new methods and cutting-edge technologies
