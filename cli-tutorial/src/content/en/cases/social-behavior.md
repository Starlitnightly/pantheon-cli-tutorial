# Survey Data Analysis: IFD Software Design Capability Acceptance Study

## Case Overview

This is a case based on **real Pantheon CLI session recordings**, demonstrating how to analyze behavioral intention survey data. The research theme is "Learning Acceptance Behavioral Intentions of Information Flow Diagram (IFD) Capability in Software Design," with data from 500 university students' questionnaire surveys, covering core constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM): **Behavioral Intention (BI), Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), Attitude (ATT), Information Flow Diagram Ability (IFDA), Business Requirements Expectations (BURE), Software Design Satisfaction (SWDS), and Actual Use (ACT)**.

## Research Background

This study surveyed students from computer science, information technology, and software engineering programs at four universities in Thailand (Rangsit University, Eastern University of Science and Technology, Bangkok University, and Chulalongkorn University) regarding their acceptance of Information Flow Diagram (IFD) learning. The questionnaire employed 5-point and 7-point Likert scales, based on the **Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)** framework, exploring the application value of IFD capabilities in software design education.

## Real Analysis Workflow

### Core User Inputs
Based on real session recordings, users employed the following key instruction sequence:

**1. Document Exploration Request**:
```
could you read the pdf in data_behav?
```

**2. Data Directory Exploration**:
```
could you explore the directory of data_behav, all file related Dataset for Behavioral Intentions based on Learning Acceptance of Information Flow Diagram Capability for Software Design
```

**3. Statistical Analysis Request**:
```
Perform EFA (Exploratory Factor Analysis)
```

**4. Results Interpretation Request**:
```
could you explain the factor with pdf, i need a conclusion.
```

**5. Report Generation Request**:
```
i want to visualize these result and save as a report with markdown format.
```

This complete user input sequence demonstrates Pantheon CLI's powerful capability for **progressive analytical conversations**: a complete research workflow from document reading, data exploration, statistical analysis to results interpretation and report generation.
