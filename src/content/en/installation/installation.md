# Pantheon-CLI Complete Installation Guide

Welcome to Pantheon-CLI! This guide will help you successfully install Pantheon-CLI on any operating system.

## What is Pantheon-CLI?

Unlike competing products like Claude Code and Gemini-CLI, **Pantheon-CLI depends on a local Python environment**. Simply put, Pantheon-CLI has a completely different development philosophy from similar competing products.

This design enables you to:
- **Complete local processing**: All data analysis is performed on your machine
- **Seamless Python ecosystem integration**: Direct use of pandas, numpy, matplotlib and other libraries
- **Mixed programming**: Perfect combination of natural language and code
- **High-performance computing**: Full utilization of local hardware resources

## Quick Installation (Recommended Path)

### Step 1: Install Python Environment Manager

We strongly recommend using **miniforge**, though installing Anaconda or miniconda is also perfectly fine:

#### Option 1: miniforge (Recommended)
- **Windows**: Download [Miniforge3-Windows-x86_64.exe](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases)
- **macOS**: `curl -L -O https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh && bash Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh`
- **Linux**: `curl -L -O https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh && bash Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh`

#### Option 2: Anaconda
Visit [Anaconda official website](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) to download the installer for your system

#### Option 3: miniconda  
Visit [miniconda official website](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/) to download the lightweight version

### Step 2: Create Dedicated Environment

```bash
# Create dedicated environment for Pantheon-CLI
conda create -n pantheon python=3.11

# Activate environment
conda activate pantheon
```

### Step 3: Install Pantheon-CLI

Currently, Pantheon-CLI is published on PyPI and installation is very simple:

```bash
