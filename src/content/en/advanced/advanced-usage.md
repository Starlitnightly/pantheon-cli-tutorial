# Advanced Usage

Pantheon-CLI is an end-to-end data science solution. Therefore, in addition to conversational analysis, we also have a built-in series of tools. These tools are extensible, allowing users to write their own tools to perform complex automated analysis. Additionally, we can use Todo to define automated analysis workflows, so that next time we encounter the same analysis, we don't have to repeat the same conversations over and over again.

## General Tool Invocation

Currently, Pantheon-CLI has built-in 60+ tools. By combining these tools, we can achieve our analysis goals to the maximum extent. For example, we can have it first read the content of a web tutorial, then perform analysis. We can also have it read PDF content from papers, then perform analysis, etc.

## Domain-Specific Tool Invocation

Currently, Pantheon-CLI has built-in RNA-seq upstream analysis, ATAC-seq upstream analysis, scRNA-seq cell annotation, 10x-HD cell segmentation, and small molecule-protein docking.
